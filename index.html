            The two graphs are very similar and follow the same trends. The posts about Ukraine worldwide peaked in 2022 Q2, shortly after the Russian invasion, with over 20.000 posts. However, as time progresses, the number of posts has steadily declined, this indicates a reduction in the global attention about the war happening in Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine remains critical. It’s essential to keep showing international support to Ukraine, and show their challenges are not forgotten.

    <p id="section3description">The two graphs illustrate the distribution of Facebook posts about Ukraine, emphasizing the roles of politics, media, and society. It is evident that media accounts contribute the largest volume of posts regarding the Ukrainian war.

        When examining political engagement, the graph on the left represents global activity, while the graph on the right focuses specifically on Denmark. The data indicates that politicians worldwide are significantly more engaged in discussing the war compared to Danish politicians, highlighting a disparity in political involvement between Denmark and the rest of the world.</p>
