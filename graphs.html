            The two graphs show on worldwide basis how media focused on the war in ukraine and how Denmark focused on the war by post count. The posts about Ukraine worldwide peaked in 2022 Q2, shortly after the Russian invasion, with over 20.000 posts. However, as time passed, the number of posts has steadily declined, this indicates a reduction in the global attention about the war happening in Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine remains critical. Itâ€™s essential to keep showing international support to Ukraine, and show their challenges are not forgotten.

        <p id="section2description2">
            In 2023Q1 we see yet another peak in the graph. This peak is caused by the military operations getting attention and the Russian attacks towards the Ukrainian energy infrastructure getting attacked and the increased drone and missile usages in the period. Also Vladimir Putin signes a decree to increase the number of Russian military personnel by 170.000. Clearly this has caused a shockwave on media platforms focussing on the war at the time.

    <p id="section3description">The two graphs illustrate the distribution of Facebook posts about Ukraine, emphasizing the roles of politics, media, and society. It is evident that media accounts contribute the largest volume of posts regarding the Ukrainian war.

        When examining political engagement, the graph on the left represents global activity, while the graph on the right focuses specifically on Denmark. The data indicates that politicians worldwide are significantly more engaged in discussing the war compared to Danish politicians, highlighting a disparity in political involvement between Denmark and the rest of the world. Obviously there are more data on worldwide scale than in Denmark only but what is interesting is how during the build up towards the danish election, Politicians show an increased amount of interested towards the war. Although as soon as the election was over, the numbers dropped drastically.</p>
    <p id="section3description2">It's quite clear the focus is not a constant, and appears stronger upon important political times but then again, a lot of the attention gathered around 2022Q1 and 2023Q1 are due to increasing military acts.</p>

    <p id="section4description">In Denmark we have a quite neutral point of view towrds the war. Although there was about 3 times more who supportet Ukraine in 2022Q2 which is similar to 2024Q1. What is positive though is that we've obtained about 10% more supporters since 2022Q2 percentwise. What is the issue though is the postcount has decreased for about 10 times since 2022Q1. This means there has been fewer posts and shares since then which is and issue since Ukraine need all the help the can get.</p>
